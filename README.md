I have downloaded the famous and one of the most basic iris flower dataset from kaggel and then implemented 3 models logistic regression , kernel svm and random forest classification(10 trees)

data was pretty much clean and didnt have missing value so i didnt apply any sort of feature scaling or any sort of data preprocessing
